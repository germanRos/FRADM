# This code implements the Fixed-Rank Alternated Direction Method with Augmented
# Lagrange Multiplier 
# algorithm for Robust Fixed-Rank Sparse Decompositions.
#
# D - m x n matrix of probably corrupted data
#
# lambda - weight on sparse error term in the cost function
#
# tol - tolerance for stopping criterion.
#
# maxIter - maximum number of iterations
#
# This code has been developed by:
